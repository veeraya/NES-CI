This repo is a port of the website from Ruby on Rails (code [here](https://github.com/veeraya/NES-website)) to CodeIgniter because these are just static pages. Having subdomains using wordpress and the main website using Rails makes DNS setting rather complicated since we need two different host. For the sake of simplicity, the website is now in php and only one host is used.


Tech stack:
